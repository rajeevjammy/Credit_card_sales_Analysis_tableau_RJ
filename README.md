📘 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard that analyzes key metrics and trends related to credit card usage, customer segmentation, spending patterns, and profitability. The goal is to help stakeholders gain actionable insights into customer behavior, risk, and revenue performance.

🎯 Objectives

Understand customer spending patterns and payment behaviors.

Identify high-value customers and potential defaulters.

Analyze transaction volumes, credit utilization, and revenue contribution by demographics.

Enable data-driven decisions for marketing and risk management teams.

📊 Dashboard Highlights

The Tableau dashboard includes:

Customer Demographics Overview

Age, gender, occupation, and income segmentation.

Spending & Transaction Analysis

Monthly spending trends and transaction categories.

Credit Utilization Insights

Average credit utilization rate and outstanding balances.

Revenue and Profitability

Revenue by customer segment and card type.

Customer Risk & Delinquency

Default rates and payment delays by segment.

🧠 Insights Derived

High-income professionals contribute the most to total revenue.

Customers with utilization rates >80% are more likely to default.

Gold and Platinum cardholders show higher spending frequency but lower delinquency.

Marketing focus should shift toward customers aged 30–45, as they represent the most profitable group.
